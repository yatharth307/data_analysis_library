# NumPy:

* NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

* Key Features: Efficient data storage and manipulation, mathematical functions for arrays, linear algebra operations, random number generation, and integration with other data analysis libraries.

# Pandas:  

* Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides easy-to-use data structures and functions to work with structured data, making it suitable for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis tasks.

* Key Features: Data structures like DataFrame and Series, data alignment, merging and joining datasets, data filtering, aggregation, and handling missing data.

# Matplotlib:

* Matplotlib is a comprehensive plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It offers a wide variety of plotting functions to generate publication-quality figures and charts.

* Key Features: Support for various plot types (line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.), customization options for appearance and style, integration with Jupyter notebooks, and ability to export plots in different formats.

# Seaborn:

* Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a higher-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics, with emphasis on exploring and understanding relationships in data.

* Key Features: Simplified syntax for common statistical plots, support for complex visualizations like heatmaps, pair plots, and violin plots, integration with Pandas DataFrame objects, and built-in themes for improving plot aesthetics.
